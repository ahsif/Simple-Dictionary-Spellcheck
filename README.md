# Simple-Dictionary-Spellcheck
The words in the hard coded dictionary are as follows:

"a", "about", "again", "all", "an",  "and", "areas",   "at",  "be", "but", "by", "can", "do" ,"down" ,"first", "for", "from", "good", "have", "he", "her", "here", "him", "his", "I", "if", "in", "into", "is", "it", "just", "like", "listen", "little", "make", "man", "many",  "may", "more", "most", "my", "near", "no", "not", "now",  "of", "on", "one", "only", "or", "other", "out", "people", "please", "program", "read", "said", "say", "see", "she", "should", "slow", "small", "so", "some", "stop", "than",  "that", "the", "then",  "there", "they",  "this",  "through", "to", "tomorrow", "true", "two", "up", "use", "very", "water", "was", "way", "we", "were", "what", "when", "where", "which",  "while", "who",  "will",  "with", "would", "write",  "yes", "yesterday", "you"


The program simply hash codes all of the words above into a map and then takes a user input and finds if the words are either an exact match, differ by one character, or differ by more than one character and either gives its best approximation on which would it could possibly be, or encases the words in brackets stating that the algorithm could not find a reliable match.


While this is an earlier program that was written near the beginning of my schooling I believe it taught me the value of libraries that we are able to implement for ease of coding. This assignment was constrained in that we were only allowed to use certain libraries and others were considered forbidden that would have made this program much easier (and more accurate).

In order to test the program please look through the dictionary and make a type-o in the words when it prompts for user input.
thank you for your time
